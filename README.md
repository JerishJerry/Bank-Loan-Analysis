# Bank-Loan-Analysis
Project Description:

The Bank Loan Analysis project is a comprehensive initiative designed to enhance the loan evaluation process through a meticulous examination of key performance indicators (KPIs) using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. This multifaceted approach delves into various aspects of loan data to provide insightful metrics for stakeholders.

KPI_1: Year-wise Loan Amount Stats
The first key performance indicator revolves around analyzing loan amounts every year. By employing Excel and SQL, the project dissects the dataset to derive statistics related to loan amounts over different years. This KPI sheds light on trends, identifying periods of increased or decreased loan activity and aiding in strategic planning and decision-making.

KPI_2: Grade and Subgrade-wise Revol_bal
Utilizing SQL and Excel, the project explores the correlation between loan grades, subgrades, and revolving balance (revol_bal). This analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution of revolving balances across various loan grades and subgrades, aiding in risk assessment and portfolio management.

KPI_3: Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Total Payment for Non-Verified Status
The third KPI involves a comparison of total payments for loan statuses categorized as verified and non-verified. Leveraging Excel and SQL, the project scrutinizes payment data to discern any significant differences between these two statuses. This insight aids in understanding payment behaviour, allowing the bank to refine its verification processes and optimize risk management strategies.

KPI_4: State-wise and Last_Credit_Pull_D Wise Loan Status - Final
Employing Tableau and SQL, the project examines loan status trends based on geographic location and the timing of the last credit pull. This KPI provides a comprehensive view of loan performance across states and over time, facilitating targeted interventions and risk mitigation strategies tailored to specific regions and credit evaluation periods.

KPI_5: Home Ownership Vs Last Payment Date Stats
The fifth KPI explores the relationship between home ownership and last payment dates. Using Power BI and SQL, the project analyzes statistics related to payment timelines based on different home ownership categories. This KPI assists in understanding payment behaviour patterns associated with different home ownership types, informing strategies to mitigate risks and enhance loan repayment.

In conclusion, the Bank Loan Analysis project employs a robust combination of Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to analyze key performance indicators, offering a nuanced understanding of loan-related trends and behaviours. The insights derived from these KPIs contribute to informed decision-making, enabling the bank to refine its loan evaluation processes, optimize risk management strategies, and ensure favourable outcomes for both the institution and loan applicants.
